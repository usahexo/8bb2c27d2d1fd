For the Maelstrom, you’ll need to have reached rank 3 in your Maelstrom allegiance, while for The Order of the Twin Adder you’ll need to have reached rank 3 in your Twelfth Legion allegiance.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed these requirements, you’ll be able to find the Alliance Roulette under the Duty tab in Revenant’s Toll. From there, simply select it and choose your alliance. You’ll then be placed into a queue where you’ll be matched up with other players from your alliance.</p>
<p>The objective of the Alliance Roulette is to work together with your team to defeat as many enemies as possible before time runs out. The more enemies you defeat, the better your rewards will be. However, keep in mind that enemies will become stronger as time goes on, so it’s important to stay on top of your game if you want to come out on top.</p>
<p>And that’s all there is to know about unlocking and playing the Alliance Roulette in Final Fantasy XIV! Be sure to give it a try next time you’re online and see how well you can do with your team. Good luck!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-the-Sigil-of-Alliance-Roulette-in-Final-Fantasy-XIV"><a href="#How-to-Get-the-Sigil-of-Alliance-Roulette-in-Final-Fantasy-XIV" class="headerlink" title="How to Get the Sigil of Alliance Roulette in Final Fantasy XIV"></a>How to Get the Sigil of Alliance Roulette in Final Fantasy XIV</h1><p>In the world of Eorzea, there are many items that players want but cannot easily obtain. One such item is the Sigil of Alliance Roulette, a rewards item from the alliance raid dungeon Alexander: Gordias. This sigil can be used to teleport players directly to Alexander: Gordias, skipping all other areas in the game. Obtaining this sigil can be a challenge, but with the right methods it can be done.</p>
<p>The first step is to complete the duty called “A New Direction” which is available at level 70. This duty tasks players with gathering supplies for an airship bound for The Fringes - Alexander: Gordias. After gathering all of the supplies, speak to Garlond Ironstone in Mor Dhona to receive your invitation to The Fringes.</p>
<p>Once in The Fringes, speak to Reddick in Idyllshire and accept his quest “Prey on the Weak.” This quest requires players to kill 30 Ixali Hunters and 30 Ixali Ravagers. After completing this quest, speak to Reddick again and he will give you an Ixali Vase which starts the next step in obtaining the Sigil of Alliance Roulette.</p>
<p>In order to enter Alexander: Gordias, players must have a full party of 8 allies and must defeat the mini-bosses along the way. The first mini-boss can be found by heading east from where The Fringes begins, then going down into The Dravanian Hinterlands. There is a large tree near where the mini-boss is located; simply break off one of its branches and it will start moving - this is your cue to attack!</p>
<p>The next mini-boss can be found by traveling east from Old Gridania into The Black Shroud, then heading north until you reach an area called Hasla Free Company Workshops. From there, go northeast until you reach a small lake; the mini-boss will be swimming in it.</p>
<p>After defeating both mini-bosses, return to Reddick in Idyllshire and he will give you an Ixali Tablet which starts the next step in obtaining the Sigil of Alliance Roulette.</p>
<p>This tablet must be taken to High Commander Thancred in Ul’dah who will give you a token called “The Rising.” Take this token back to Reddick in Idyllshire who will give you a key item called “Bonds of Fellowship.” With this key item, travel back to The Fringes and speak with Garlond Ironstone who will finally let you enter Alexander: Gordias!</p>
