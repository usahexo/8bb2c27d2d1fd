#  Why Can Arcades Have Gambling in Gran Canaria?

There are two types of casinos in Gran Canaria - the ones that are located in the resorts and those that are in the arcades. The arcades are legal because they offer other forms of gambling such as bingo, video lottery terminals (VLTs) and roulette, which are seen as games of chance and not a form of gambling. So far, the arcades have not had any problems with the authorities, but there is always a concern that this could change in the future.

The reason why arcade casinos can offer gambling is because they are licensed to do so by the government. This is something that has been in place for many years and is seen as a way to bring in more tourism revenue to the island. In fact, most of the arcades are owned by British companies, which is why you will find many UK-style casino games like bingo and roulette.

The main benefit of having arcades with gambling is that it gives people more choice when it comes to where they can gamble. This is important, as it means that people don't have to go to the resorts if they want to play games of chance. It also helps to create jobs on the island, as there are many people who work in the arcade casinos.

The downside of having arcades with gambling is that there is always a risk that they could be shut down by the authorities at any time. This has happened in other parts of Spain, so it is something that casino operators need to be aware of. Another issue is that some people see arcade casinos as being less reputable than those located in resorts. This may be because there are fewer restrictions on what they can offer customers.
