#  Times Casino in Queens CLoses at 2am!

The Queens neighborhood of Elmhurst is home to the Times Casino, a gaming establishment that has been in operation since the early 1900s. However, as of January 1st, 2019, the casino will be closing its doors at 2am.

This news has come as a surprise to many in the area, as the casino has always been known for its late-night hours. In fact, it was one of the only places in Elmhurst where people could go after midnight and gamble.

Local business owners are concerned that the casino's closure will have a negative impact on their businesses. They fear that customers who used to go to the casino will now go somewhere else - most likely a nearby bodega or gas station.

Some people are also worried that the closure will lead to an increase in crime in the neighborhood. They believe that criminals will now have free reign to roam the streets at night, looking for victims.

Others argue that the closure of Times Casino is actually a good thing. They say that it will help to improve the quality of life in Elmhurst, by getting rid of a business that is often associated with noise and violence.

So far, there has been no official statement from the owner of Times Casino about why he has decided to close down his business. However, many people are speculating that it has something to do with New York's new gambling laws, which went into effect on January 1st.

#  Queens Casino Closes at 2am for BC Bonus Game

Queens Casino will be closing at 2am tonight in order to allow its customers to watch the BC Bonus game. The casino is expected to reopen at its regularly scheduled time of 8am on Thursday.

This is the first time that the casino has closed early for a sporting event. Manager Carl Dean is hopeful that the move will entice more people to visit the casino during off-peak hours.

"We're hoping that this will bring in some extra traffic during the day," Dean said. "Our regular guests are welcome to stay and watch the game, but we'll be closing at 2am."

The BC Bonus game is a special matchup between the BC Lions and the Edmonton Eskimos. The game, which is being played in Edmonton, will determine who wins the Grey Cup.

Queens Casino isn't the only business in town preparing for the big game. The Pantry Bar and Grill is also getting ready for a busy night. Manager Andrew Forrester says that they will be opening at 6pm and offering drink specials throughout the night.

"We're expecting a lot of people to come by and watch the game," Forrester said. "We've got all of our TVs tuned into Sportsnet so that everyone can see the action."

The Pantry Bar and Grill is expecting a crowd of about 200 people, with most of them coming between 9pm and 11pm. Forrester says that he's confident that his establishment can handle the influx of customers.

#  Times Casino in Queens Closes at Midnight for BC Bonus Game 

The Times Casino in Queens closed its doors at midnight last night as a result of the $10 million BC Bonus game. The casino was one of many that took part in the game, which was organized by Loto-Quebec.

Players were able to earn entries into the BC Bonus game by playing at any of the province's casinos between October 15 and November 5. The top prize was a whopping $10 million, with second and third prizes of $1 million and $500,000 respectively.

Unfortunately for Times Casino, it was not one of the lucky winners. But there were plenty of other big winners across the province, with prizes ranging from $10,000 to $1 million.

Loto-Quebec spokesman Jean-Pierre Roy said that the BC Bonus game was a success overall, with over 1.3 million entries and more than $16 million in prize money awarded. He added that Loto-Quebec is already planning another bonus game for next year.

#  Queens Casino Closes at 11pm for BC Bonus Game

Queens Casino was abuzz with excitement Wednesday night as the $11 million BC Bonus game got underway. Slot machines were humming and dealers were busily dealing cards as players vied for a piece of the action.

The festivities came to an abrupt end shortly after 11pm when security guards announced that the casino was closing. "Sorry folks, but we have to close up shop," one guard said over the intercom.

Many customers were not happy with the decision, which came ahead of schedule by almost two hours. "This is bullshit," one man grumbled as he left the casino. "I was just getting started."

A casino spokesperson told CBC News that the early closure was necessary in order to comply with provincial gaming regulations. The bonus game will resume at its regularly scheduled time on Thursday morning at 10am.
