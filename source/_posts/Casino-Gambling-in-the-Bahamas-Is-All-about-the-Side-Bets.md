For example, after the player has been dealt their two cards, they may place a bet on whether they will draw another card and bust (or hit) or whether the dealer will bust. Another popular side bet is wagering on whether the player will receive a blackjack (a hand totaling 21 points). 

Side gambling can also involve betting on other aspects of the game such as the number of rounds that will be played or who will win the next hand. The possibilities are endless, but it’s important to remember that not all side bets are created equal. Some offer good odds while others are much less favorable for the player. 

Before placing any bets, it’s important to do some research and find out which bets offer the best chance of winning. There are many resources available online that have detailed information about blackjack odds and strategies for improving your chances of winning. Armed with this information, you can increase your chances of winning at blackjack and enjoy some extra excitement while you play.

3. The Inside Bet

This is a more risky bet, but it comes with some pretty good rewards if you win. To make an inside bet, you'll need to put your money on one particular number or set of numbers. If that number or set of numbers comes up on the next roll, you'll win big!

4. The Street Bet

This is another high-risk/high-reward option that's perfect for those who want to make a quick buck. To make a street bet, simply put your money on the line at the end of any row of numbers. If the next roll matches any number on your row, you'll win!
