#  How to Get the Sigil of Alliance Roulette in Final Fantasy XIV

In the world of Eorzea, there are many items that players want but cannot easily obtain. One such item is the Sigil of Alliance Roulette, a rewards item from the alliance raid dungeon Alexander: Gordias. This sigil can be used to teleport players directly to Alexander: Gordias, skipping all other areas in the game. Obtaining this sigil can be a challenge, but with the right methods it can be done.

The first step is to complete the duty called "A New Direction" which is available at level 70. This duty tasks players with gathering supplies for an airship bound for The Fringes - Alexander: Gordias. After gathering all of the supplies, speak to Garlond Ironstone in Mor Dhona to receive your invitation to The Fringes.

Once in The Fringes, speak to Reddick in Idyllshire and accept his quest "Prey on the Weak." This quest requires players to kill 30 Ixali Hunters and 30 Ixali Ravagers. After completing this quest, speak to Reddick again and he will give you an Ixali Vase which starts the next step in obtaining the Sigil of Alliance Roulette.

In order to enter Alexander: Gordias, players must have a full party of 8 allies and must defeat the mini-bosses along the way. The first mini-boss can be found by heading east from where The Fringes begins, then going down into The Dravanian Hinterlands. There is a large tree near where the mini-boss is located; simply break off one of its branches and it will start moving - this is your cue to attack!

The next mini-boss can be found by traveling east from Old Gridania into The Black Shroud, then heading north until you reach an area called Hasla Free Company Workshops. From there, go northeast until you reach a small lake; the mini-boss will be swimming in it.

After defeating both mini-bosses, return to Reddick in Idyllshire and he will give you an Ixali Tablet which starts the next step in obtaining the Sigil of Alliance Roulette.

This tablet must be taken to High Commander Thancred in Ul'dah who will give you a token called "The Rising." Take this token back to Reddick in Idyllshire who will give you a key item called "Bonds of Fellowship." With this key item, travel back to The Fringes and speak with Garlond Ironstone who will finally let you enter Alexander: Gordias!
