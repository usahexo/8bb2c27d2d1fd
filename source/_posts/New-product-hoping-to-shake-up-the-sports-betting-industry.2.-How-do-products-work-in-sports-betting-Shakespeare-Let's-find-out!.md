# 5. Product Spotlight: How Does Sports Betting Shakespeare Work?

In recent years, there’s been a big increase in the number of people sports betting, whether it’s through joining an online sportsbook or placing a bet with a friend. But what actually is sports betting and how does it work?

To put it simply, sports betting is when someone places a wager on the outcome of a sporting event. This can be done either online or in person at a physical bookmaker. The wager can be as little as £1 or as much as £1,000,000 (or more!), depending on the sport and the odds offered.

When you place a wager, you are essentially betting against someone else (known as the ‘bookmaker’) that your chosen team or player will win or lose the event. If your team wins, you receive your original stake back plus the winnings (the odds multiplied by the amount you wagered). If your team loses, you lose your original stake minus any winnings (the odds multiplied by the amount you wagered).

It’s important to note that not all sporting events offer odds for betting. The most popular events for sports betting are football (soccer), horse racing, boxing, and American football. Basketball, cricket, and rugby are also increasing in popularity for sports betting.

There are a few different types of bets that can be placed:

Outright Betting – Betting on who will win an event outright (e.g. who will win the Premier League?).

Match Betting – Betting on the result of an individual match (e.g. Manchester United to beat Liverpool?).

Tie Betting – Betting on whether or not there will be a draw (e.g. Arsenal vs Chelsea?).

Point Spread Betting – Betting on how many points one team will beat another by (e.g. Man City to beat Newcastle by 2 goals?).
This type of bet is also known as American Handicap Betting .

Proposition Bet or Prop Bets – A type of bet that focuses on specific incidents within a game rather than the overall outcome (e.g Will Luis Suarez score?)
